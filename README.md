# Sunburst

Noasis to Stanley Rost's Sunburst TextMate theme.

N.B. Styles that I haven't gotten to yet are styled as italic/#ff0000 so they're noticeable when they appear.

## Credits

[Stanley Rost](https://stanleyrost.net), obviously, for creating the original, and [Allen Bargi](https://github.com/aziz) for creating the amazing [TextMate theme editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Sunburst), which I used to help create this.
