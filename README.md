# Sunburst

The Noasis of [Nova](http://nova.app) themes: a loving ~rip off~ homage of Stanley Rost's Sunburst TextMate theme.

## Installation

1. Select Extensions > Extension Library from the Nova menu (or if you're a smarty pants, press shift-apple-2).
2. Search for "Sunburst" or browse the Themes tab until you find it.
3. Click install.

## A few things to bear in mind

Because we can't have nice things, there are of course a few issues:

- The [docs for themes](https://docs.nova.app/extensions/themes/) are out of step with the template Nova gives you and it's unclear which is right.
- There is currently no icon because… time.
- Vibrancy is off because it was doing weird things to the sidebars.
- There isn't really a 1:1 mapping for some things, so I've had to go with what's best – the most noticeable is what are defined as `keywords` in Nova vs in Textmate/SublimeText.
- It's not currently possible to style sub-tags in HTML.
- Indented SASS comments are borked and I have no idea why.
- There are a few styles that I haven't gotten around to changing yet, largely because I don't use languages that would use them – these are styled as italic/#ff0000 so they're noticeable when they appear.
- The examples for the screenshots were copied and pasted from the TextMate theme editor – don't get your panties in a bunch|knickers in a twist (delete as applicable) if there are syntax errors in them.

## Credits

[Stanley Rost](https://stanleyrost.net), obviously, for creating the original, and [Allen Bargi](https://github.com/aziz) for creating the amazing [TextMate theme editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Sunburst), which I used to help convert this to Nova.
